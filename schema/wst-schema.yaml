      Each item can either represent a predefined action (as a string) or a custom action (as an object). When using
      predefined actions like expectations and requests, the action names are given as strings with its constituent
      parts separated by slashes.

      When these items are executed, if any failure occurs, the execution is halted and the error is reported. In some
      cases, an action may generate a result value that can be utilized by subsequent action items.

      Among these actions, there are three special types. The 'not' action performs a logical negation on the result of
      the action item it is associated with. This means if the associated action fails, it is treated as a success and
      the execution of further items continues without reporting an error. The 'parallel' action takes an array of
      actions and executes them simultaneously. The 'parallel' action only completes when all of its parallel actions
      end. If any action within 'parallel' fails, that particular action is stopped, but others continue their
      execution. The 'sequential' action takes an array of actions and executes them in order, stopping at the first
      failure and skipping any remaining actions.
